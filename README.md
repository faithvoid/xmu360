# xmu360
xmu360 - an Xbox 360 Memory Unit to Xbox Memory Unit adapter. (WIP)

## Required Components:
- Xbox 360 Memory Unit
- Original Xbox controller (or adapter / wireless receiver with memory card inputs)
- AMS1117 3.3V voltage regulator (as the memory card uses 3.3v as opposed to standard 5v that USB ports provide)
- USB-A female socket
- PCBs from your manufacturer of choice (not ready yet!)

## Installation:
- Populate the USB & 3.3v regulator slots on the PCB with the required components (if not pre-assembled)
- Insert into Xbox controller or memory card adapter
- To verify that the adapter is working as intended, go to the Xbox dashboard, go to Memory, and your 360 memory card should show up as a standard Xbox memory unit!
